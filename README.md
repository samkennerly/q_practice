# q_practice
When I can't remember how to do something simple in Q, I use these .q scripts as reminders.

### demo.q
To run this script interactively:
- go to whatever folder contains demo.q
- start a q session
- type this:
```
\l demo.q
```

### normrand.q
These convenience functions generate normally-distributed pseudorandom samples.  
The *bm* function is borrowed from https://github.com/psaris/qtips/blob/master/stat.q .
